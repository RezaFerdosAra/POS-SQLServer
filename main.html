It consists of several specialized tables and schemas, storing and processing all information related to products, categories, customers, invoices, and financial transactions in a well-structured manner. The optimized schema of tables and objects enables clear separation and organization of data based on business logic areas, customer identity, and financial operations.
<br>
This project is built to demonstrate advanced skills in database design and implementation, featuring a collection of optimized and practical Stored Procedures for supporting application-layer operations, intelligent Triggers for event monitoring and automated data management, and analytical and aggregate Views for simplifying reporting and data analysis. In addition, Table-Valued Functions (TVFs) have been created for specialized reporting, and User-Defined Types (UDTs) have been implemented to provide reusable data structures across the system.
<br>
To enhance organization and scalability, a well-structured schema design has been implemented along with Synonyms to facilitate cross-schema object referencing. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, scalable, and production-ready database model that seamlessly addresses both operational requirements and reporting/analytical needs in a unified solution.
